# Swizzle
Swizzle was a browser-based service where anyone could spin up a full stack app within their browser. The company wound down in early 2024, but the code has been made public.

Some features we were proud of
- One click deployment of a NodeJS backend and React frontend
- In browser IDE with step through debugging, logging, and AI autocomplete
- Drop in authentication, file storage, and MongoDB database
- Slick logs with the full body, headers, and logs for every request
- An AI assistant that could build multiple endpoints and frontend pages at the same time from simple prompts and figma designs

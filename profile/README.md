# Swizzle
Swizzle was a fully browser-based service for building full stack apps. The company wound down in early 2024, but the code has been made public.

Some features we were proud of
- One click deployment of a NodeJS backend and React frontend
- An in browser IDE with a language server, step through debugging, logs, a postman-style request tester, and AI code complete
- Drop in authentication, file storage, and a MongoDB database
- Slick logs with the full body, headers, and logs for every request
- Shared types between the frontend and the backend, making debugging much easier
- Scheduled functions, autoscaling, HTTPS, and other niceties for developers
- An AI assistant that could build multiple endpoints and frontend pages at the same time from simple prompts and figma designs
